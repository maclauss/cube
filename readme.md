# Welcome to Cube

This is a very simplistic game developed using Unity, following the excellent tutorial from [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA). The goal is not so much to develop a real game but rather to learn the basics of game development and of the Unity game engine.
